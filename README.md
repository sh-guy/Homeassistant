# Homeassistant Snippits
Just some Home Assistant related stuff I wanted to archive.

- Viessmann ViCare
My integration of the ViCare Cloud from Viessmann without the use of developer API keys.
This intgration emulates how the ViCare App connects to the ViCare Cloud. The advantage of this integration is that the App does not have the same limitations as a standard API user and therefore can get access ot things like Smart Thermostats and Climate Sensors without needing a premium subscription.
My intention was just to get the same data in my Homeassistant that I get in the App without needing to pay for a premium API subscription just to get what I already get in the App for free.

Now, this is not really an "integration" for Homeassistant, but rather some scripts and YAML code to create sensors.
